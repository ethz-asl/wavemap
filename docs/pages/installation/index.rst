Installation
############
Wavemap can be installed on your system in several ways.
All of the framework's main functionalities are available through a lightweight, high performance C++ library that can be installed and used as a pure CMake package.
To support faster prototyping and easier integration with learning-based systems, we are also actively working on making wavemap available as a Python module.
For roboticists working with ROS, we provide packages that tightly integrate wavemap into ROS1's ecosystem.

.. note::

    If you're interested in using wavemap with ROS2 and willing to contribute, please get in touch `here <https://github.com/ethz-asl/wavemap/issues/43>`_.
