C++ API

.. rstcheck: ignore-roles=gh_file

In this tutorial, we illustrate how you can use wavemap's C++ API in your own projects.

.. tip::

    An example package that combines the setup steps and code examples that follow can be found :gh_file:`here <examples/cpp>`.

CMake target setup
******************
Once you included wavemap's C++ library in your CMake project, for example by following our :doc:`installation instructions <../installation/cpp>`, the last remaining step to start using it is to configure your CMake target (e.g. library or executable) to use it.

Wavemap's C++ library contains three main components:

* ``wavemap_core``: The framework's core algorithms, data structures and utilities
* ``wavemap_io``: Functions to read and write maps to streams and files
* ``wavemap_pipeline``: A measurement integration and map management pipeline

For an example executable that performs some operations on a map after reading it from a file, you would need to link:

.. code-block:: cmake

      add_executable(your_executable your_code.cc)
      target_link_libraries(your_executable
            PUBLIC wavemap::wavemap_core wavemap::wavemap_io)

Note that this will automatically make wavemap's include directories (headers) available to `your_code.cc`.

We **strongly recommend** to also call the ``set_wavemap_target_properties`` function to ensure your target's compilation options are compatible with those of wavemap:

.. code-block:: cmake

      set_wavemap_target_properties(your_executable)

.. _cpp-code-examples:

Code examples
*************
In the following sections, you'll find sample code for common tasks. If you'd like to request examples for additional tasks or contribute new examples, please don't hesitate to `contact us <https://github.com/ethz-asl/wavemap/issues>`_.

Mapping
=======
The only requirements to build wavemap maps are that you have a set of

1. depth measurements,
2. sensor pose (estimates) for each measurement.

We usually use depth measurements from depth cameras or 3D LiDARs, but any source would work as long as a corresponding :ref:`projection <configuration_projection_models>` and :ref:`measurement <configuration_measurement_models>` model is available. To help you get started quickly, we provide example configs for various sensor setups :gh_file:`here <interfaces/ros1/wavemap_ros/config>`. An overview of all the available settings is provided on the :doc:`parameters page <../parameters/index>`.

Example pipeline
----------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/mapping/example_pipeline.cc
    :language: cpp

Serializing maps
================
In this section, we'll demonstrate how to serialize and deserialize maps using wavemap's lightweight and efficient binary format. This format is consistent across wavemap's C++, Python, and ROS interfaces. For instance, you can create maps on a robot with ROS and later load them into a rendering engine plugin that only depends on wavemap's C++ library.

Binary files
------------
Maps can be saved to disk with

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/io/save_map_to_file.cc
    :language: c++

.. _cpp-code-examples-read-map:

and read using

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/io/load_map_from_file.cc
    :language: c++

Byte streams
------------
We also provide an alternative, lower-level interface to convert maps to (byte) streams

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/io/save_map_to_stream.cc
    :language: c++

and read them with

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/io/load_map_from_stream.cc
    :language: c++


Queries
=======
In this section, we illustrate how you can query the map and classify whether a point or region of interest is occupied.

Node indices
------------
The map models the environment by filling it with cubes of variable sizes, arranged as the nodes of an octree. Node indices are defined as integer [X, Y, Z, height] coordinates, whose XYZ values correspond to the node's position in the octree's grid at the given *height*, or level in the tree. Height 0 corresponds to the map's maximum resolution, and the grid resolution is halved for each subsequent height level.

Fixed resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Querying the value of a single node in the highest resolution grid (*height=0*) can be done as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/queries/fixed_resolution.cc
    :language: c++

Multi-res averages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is also possible to query lower resolution nodes, whose values correspond to the average estimated occupancy of the volume they cover.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/queries/multi_resolution.cc
    :language: c++

Accelerators
^^^^^^^^^^^^
In case you intend to look up multiple node values, we recommend using wavemap's query accelerator which traverses the octree significantly faster by caching parent nodes.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/queries/accelerated_queries.cc
    :language: c++

.. _cpp-code-examples-interpolation:

Real coordinates
----------------
Many applications require occupancy estimates at arbitrary 3D points, with real-valued coordinates. Such estimates are computed by interpolating the map.

.. caution::

    If your query points are expressed in a different coordinate frame than the map, do not forget to transform them into the map frame before you continue.

Nearest neighbor interpolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The simplest form of interpolation simply looks up the value of the map node that is closest to the query point.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/queries/nearest_neighbor_interpolation.cc
    :language: c++

Trilinear interpolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Another option is to linearly interpolate the map along the x, y, and z axes. This method produces cleaner, more accurate results at the cost of being slightly slower, since it needs to query 8 neighboring map nodes.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/queries/trilinear_interpolation.cc
    :language: c++

.. _cpp-code-examples-classification:

Occupancy classification
------------------------
Once the estimated occupancy at a node or point has been retrieved, it can be classified as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/cpp/queries/classification.cc
    :language: c++
